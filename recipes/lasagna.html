        want to stay true to the original recipe, though, these are the ingredients you'll<br> 
        need to add to your grocery list:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat</strong>: This super meaty lasagna has sweet Italian sausage and lean ground <br>beef.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Onion and garlic</strong>: An onion and two cloves of garlic are cooked with the <br>meat to add tons of flavor.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Tomato products</strong>: You'll need a can of crushed tomatoes, two cans of <br>tomato sauce, and two cans of tomato paste.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: Two tablespoons of white sugar add subtle sweetness and enhance <br>the flavor of the sauce.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Spices and seasonings:</strong>: This lasagna recipe is flavored with fresh parsley, <br>dried basil leaves, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and black pepper.</li>
        <li><strong>Lasagna noodles</strong>: : Use store-bought or homemade lasagna noodles.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Cheeses</strong>: Parmesan, mozzarella, and ricotta cheese make this lasagna extra <br>decadent.</li><br>
        <li><strong>Egg</strong>: An egg helps bind the ricotta so it doesn't ooze out of the lasagna when <br>you cut into it.</li><br>
    </ul>
